  <h1>Privacy Policy for DreamScape</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Today’s Date]</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>DreamScape does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All dream entries and analyses are stored locally on your device. We do not require account creation, email sign-up, or personal identifiers of any kind.</p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>DreamScape uses OpenAI’s API to provide dream interpretations. These API requests send only the dream text you submit and do not include identifying information. Requests are securely handled via a backend server hosted on Render.com to facilitate communication with OpenAI. No personal user information is stored on this server.</p>

  <h2>3. User Privacy Choices</h2>
  <p>Since DreamScape does not collect or store user data, there are no additional privacy controls required. All app data remains local to your device.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to ensure your data is secure while in use, but as with any app using third-party services, users should be aware that dream inputs sent for analysis travel over encrypted connections to OpenAI.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the app or on this page.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>[yourname@email.com]</strong></p>
